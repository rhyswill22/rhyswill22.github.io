Enter your phone number:

(check html source page for my plan)

<!-- My plan: User hits a button that rolls a dice between 1-9.
Depending on what number they land on, that is how many many advertisement blocks will appear on their screen.
Additionally, they will have to solve a random Calculus derivative. Additionally, they will have to answer an American literature trivia question.
If the user answers either question correctly through the entire process of entering the phone number, it will reset the process of entering the phone number.
The user will not be allowed to reset their answer if they hit the wrong phone number, they will have to refresh the page.-->
